Hello! This project contains my cycling training plan, which I have been following since the summer of 2021.

The primary goal of this project is to create a structured database that records and organizes the details of all my completed workouts over the years. The database includes the following key information:
• Workout Duration: Total time spent on each session.
• Heart Rate Zones: Target zones used during training.
• Workout Segments: Intervals, rest periods, and their respective details.
• Annotations and Tips: Notes and advice for specific workouts or segments.

Background
These workouts were developed in collaboration with a highly qualified coach who:
• Graduated from the Olympic Reserve School (Triathlon Department, specialization in Olympic short-distance triathlon).
• Holds a degree from the Lesgaft National State University of Physical Education, Sport, and Health.

Our training methodology was based on monitoring heart rate, power output, and subjective well-being. Over the years, I have maintained a high level of discipline, rarely missing workouts—perhaps just a couple of times per year.

Thank You
Thank you for your attention and interest in my project! I hope this repository inspires others to organize and analyze their training data in a meaningful way.
