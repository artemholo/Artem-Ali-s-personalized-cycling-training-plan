Hello. This code is my cycling training plan that I have been following since the summer of 2021. My ultimate goal at the moment is a database in the form of: descriptions of the workouts that I have done over the years. Here are: workout duration. heart rate zones that are used during the workout. segments within the workout (intervals with rest), annotations and tips. I did these workouts with a highly qualified coach who graduated from the Olympic Reserve School (triathlon department. specialization - Olympic triathlon, short distance) and the Lesgaft Sports University. We trained according to heart rate, power, well-being. I missed workouts a maximum of a couple of times a year. Thank you for your attention
